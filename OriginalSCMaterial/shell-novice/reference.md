## [Introducing the Shell](00-intro.html)

*   A shell is a program whose primary purpose is to read commands and run other programs.
*   The shell's main advantages are its high action-to-keystroke ratio,
    its support for automating repetitive tasks,
    and that it can be used to access networked machines.
*   The shell's main disadvantages are its primarily textual nature
    and how cryptic its commands and operation can be.

## [Files and Directories](01-filedir.html)

*   The file system is responsible for managing information on the disk.
*   Information is stored in files, which are stored in directories (folders).
*   Directories can also store other directories, which forms a directory tree.
*   `cd path` changes the current working directory.
*   `ls path` prints a listing of a specific file or directory;
    `ls` on its own lists the current working directory.
*   `pwd` prints the user's current working directory.
*   `whoami` shows the user's current identity.
*   `/` on its own is the root directory of the whole file system.
*   A relative path specifies a location starting from the current location.
*   An absolute path specifies a location from the root of the file system.
*   Directory names in a path are separated with '/' on Unix, but '\\' on Windows.
*   '..' means "the directory above the current one";
    '.' on its own means "the current directory".
*   Most files' names are `something.extension`.
    The extension isn't required,
    and doesn't guarantee anything,
    but is normally used to indicate the type of data in the file.
*   Most commands take options (flags) which begin with a '-'.

## [Creating Things](02-create.html)

*   `cp old new` copies a file.
*   `mkdir path` creates a new directory.
*   `mv old new` moves (renames) a file or directory.
*   `rm path` removes (deletes) a file.
*   `rmdir path` removes (deletes) an empty directory.
*   Unix documentation uses '^A' to mean "control-A".
*   The shell does not have a trash bin: once something is deleted, it's really gone.
*   Nano is a very simple text editor --- please use something else for real work.

## [Pipes and Filters](03-pipefilter.html)

*   `cat` displays the contents of its inputs.
*   `head` displays the first few lines of its input.
*   `tail` displays the last few lines of its input.
*   `sort` sorts its inputs.
*   `wc` counts lines, words, and characters in its inputs.
*   `command > file` redirects a command's output to a file.
*   `first | second` is a pipeline: the output of the first command is used as the input to the second.
*   The best way to use the shell is to use pipes to combine simple single-purpose programs (filters).

## [Loops](04-loop.html)

*   A `for` loop repeats commands once for every thing in a list.
*   Every `for` loop needs a variable to refer to the current "thing".
*   Use `$name` to expand a variable (i.e., get its value).
*   Do not use spaces, quotes, or wildcard characters such as '*' or '?' in filenames, as it complicates variable expansion.
*   Give files consistent names that are easy to match with wildcard patterns to make it easy to select them for looping.
*   Use the up-arrow key to scroll up through previous commands to edit and repeat them.
*   Use "control-r" to search through the previously entered commands.
*   Use `history` to display recent commands, and `!number` to repeat a command by number.

## [Shell Scripts](05-script.html)

*   Save commands in files (usually called shell scripts) for re-use.
*   `bash filename` runs the commands saved in a file.
*   `$*` refers to all of a shell script's command-line parameters.
*   `$1`, `$2`, etc., refer to specified command-line parameters.
*   Place variables in quotes if the values might have spaces in them.
*   Letting users decide what files to process is more flexible and more consistent with built-in Unix commands.

## [Finding Things](06-find.html)

*   `find` finds files with specific properties that match patterns.
*   `grep` selects lines in files that match patterns.
*   `man command` displays the manual page for a given command.
*   `*` matches zero or more characters in a filename, so `*.txt` matches all files ending in `.txt`.
*   `?` matches any single character in a filename, so `?.txt` matches `a.txt` but not `any.txt`.
*   `$(command)` inserts a command's output in place.

## Glossary

absolute path
:   A [path](#path) that refers to a particular location in a file system.
    Absolute paths are usually written with respect to the file system's
    [root directory](#root-directory),
    and begin with either "/" (on Unix) or "\\" (on Microsoft Windows).
    See also: [relative path](#relative-path).

argument
:   A value given to a function or program when it runs.
    The term is often used interchangeably (and inconsistently) with [parameter](#parameter).

command shell
:   See [shell](#shell)

command-line interface
:   An interface based on typing commands,
    usually at a [REPL](#read-evaluate-print-loop).
    See also: [graphical user interface](#graphical-user-interface).

comment
:   A remark in a program that is intended to help human readers understand what is going on,
    but is ignored by the computer.
    Comments in Python, R, and the Unix shell start with a `#` character and run to the end of the line;
    comments in SQL start with `--`,
    and other languages have other conventions.


current working directory
:   The directory that [relative paths](#relative-path) are calculated from;
    equivalently,
    the place where files referenced by name only are searched for.
    Every [process](#process) has a current working directory.
    The current working directory is usually referred to using the shorthand notation `.` (pronounced "dot").

file system
:   A set of files, directories, and I/O devices (such as keyboards and screens).
    A file system may be spread across many physical devices,
    or many file systems may be stored on a single physical device;
    the [operating system](#operating-system) manages access.

filename extension
:   The portion of a file's name that comes after the final "." character.
    By convention this identifies the file's type:
    `.txt` means "text file", `.png` means "Portable Network Graphics file",
    and so on. These conventions are not enforced by most operating systems:
    it is perfectly possible to name an MP3 sound file `homepage.html`.
    Since many applications use filename extensions to identify the [MIME type](#mime-type) of the file,
    misnaming files may cause those applications to fail.

filter
:   A program that transforms a stream of data.
    Many Unix command-line tools are written as filters:
    they read data from [standard input](#standard-input),
    process it, and write the result to [standard output](#standard-output).

flag
:   A terse way to specify an option or setting to a command-line program.
    By convention Unix applications use a dash followed by a single letter,
    such as `-v`, or two dashes followed by a word, such as `--verbose`,
    while DOS applications use a slash, such as `/V`.
    Depending on the application, a flag may be followed by a single argument, as in `-o /tmp/output.txt`.

for loop
:   A loop that is executed once for each value in some kind of set, list, or range.
    See also: [while loop](#while-loop).

graphical user interface
:   A graphical user interface,
    usually controlled by using a mouse.
    See also: [command-line interface](#command-line-interface).

home directory
:   The default directory associated with an account on a computer system.
    By convention, all of a user's files are stored in or below her home directory.

loop
:   A set of instructions to be executed multiple times. Consists of a [loop body](#loop-body) and (usually) a
    condition for exiting the loop. See also [for loop](#for-loop) and [while loop](#while-loop).

loop body
:   The set of statements or commands that are repeated inside a [for loop](#for-loop)
    or [while loop](#while-loop).

MIME type
:   MIME (Multi-Purpose Internet Mail Extensions) types describe different file types for exchange on the Internet,
    for example images, audio, and documents.

operating system
:   Software that manages interactions between users, hardware, and software [processes](#process). Common
    examples are Linux, OS X, and Windows.

orthogonal
:   To have meanings or behaviors that are independent of each other.
    If a set of concepts or tools are orthogonal,
    they can be combined in any way.

parameter
:   A variable named in the function's declaration that is used to hold a value passed into the call.
    The term is often used interchangeably (and inconsistently) with [argument](#argument).

parent directory
:   The directory that "contains" the one in question.
    Every directory in a file system except the [root directory](#root-directory) has a parent.
    A directory's parent is usually referred to using the shorthand notation `..` (pronounced "dot dot").

path
:   A description that specifies the location of a file or directory within a [file system](#file-system).
    See also: [absolute path](#absolute-path), [relative path](#relative-path).


pipe
:   A connection from the output of one program to the input of another.
    When two or more programs are connected in this way, they are called a "pipeline".

process
:   A running instance of a program, containing code, variable values,
    open files and network connections, and so on.
    Processes are the "actors" that the [operating system](#operating-system) manages;
    it typically runs each process for a few milliseconds at a time
    to give the impression that they are executing simultaneously.


prompt
:   A character or characters display by a [REPL](#read-evaluate-print-loop) to show that
    it is waiting for its next command.

quoting
:   (in the shell):
    Using quotation marks of various kinds to prevent the shell from interpreting special characters.
    For example, to pass the string `*.txt` to a program,
    it is usually necessary to write it as `'*.txt'` (with single quotes)
    so that the shell will not try to expand the `*` wildcard.

read-evaluate-print loop
:   (REPL): A [command-line interface](#command-line-interface) that reads a command from the user,
    executes it, prints the result, and waits for another command.

redirect
:   To send a command's output to a file rather than to the screen or another command,
    or equivalently to read a command's input from a file.

regular expression
:   A pattern that specifies a set of character strings.
    REs are most often used to find sequences of characters in strings.

relative path
:   A [path](#path) that specifies the location of a file or directory
    with respect to the [current working directory](#current-working-directory).
    Any path that does not begin with a separator character ("/" or "\\") is a relative path.
    See also: [absolute path](#absolute-path).

root directory
:   The top-most directory in a [file system](#file-system).
    Its name is "/" on Unix (including Linux and Mac OS X) and "\\" on Microsoft Windows.

shell
:   A [command-line interface](#cli) such as Bash (the Bourne-Again Shell)
    or the Microsoft Windows DOS shell
    that allows a user to interact with the [operating system](#operating-system).

shell script
:   A set of [shell](#shell) commands stored in a file for re-use.
    A shell script is a program executed by the shell;
    the name "script" is used for historical reasons.


standard input
:   A process's default input stream.
    In interactive command-line applications,
    it is typically connected to the keyboard;
    in a [pipe](#pipe),
    it receives data from the [standard output](#standard-output) of the preceding process.


standard output
:   A process's default output stream.
    In interactive command-line applications,
    data sent to standard output is displayed on the screen;
    in a [pipe](#pipe),
    it is passed to the [standard input](#standard-input) of the next process.


sub-directory
:   A directory contained within another directory.

tab completion
:   A feature provided by many interactive systems in which
    pressing the Tab key triggers automatic completion of the current word or command.

variable
:   A name in a program that is associated with a value or a collection of values.

while loop
:   A loop that keeps executing as long as some condition is true.
    See also: [for loop](#for-loop).

wildcard
:   A character used in pattern matching.
    In the Unix shell,
    the wildcard `*` matches zero or more characters,
    so that `*.txt` matches all files whose names end in `.txt`.
