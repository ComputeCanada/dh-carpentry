We now know how to explore files and directories,
but how do we create them in the first place?
Let's go back to Nelle's home directory,
`/Users/nelle`,
and use `ls -F` to see what it contains:

~~~ {.bash}
$ pwd
~~~
~~~ {.output}
/Users/nelle
~~~
~~~ {.bash}
$ ls -F
~~~
~~~ {.output}
creatures/  molecules/           pizza.cfg
data/       north-pacific-gyre/  solar.pdf
Desktop/    notes.txt            writing/
~~~

Let's create a new directory called `thesis` using the command `mkdir thesis`
(which has no output):

~~~ {.bash}
$ mkdir thesis
~~~

As you might (or might not) guess from its name,
`mkdir` means "make directory".
Since `thesis` is a relative path
(i.e., doesn't have a leading slash),
the new directory is created in the current working directory:

~~~ {.bash}
$ ls -F
~~~
~~~ {.output}
creatures/  north-pacific-gyre/  thesis/
data/       notes.txt            writing/
Desktop/    pizza.cfg
molecules/  solar.pdf
~~~

However, there's nothing in it yet:

~~~ {.bash}
$ ls -F thesis
~~~

Let's change our working directory to `thesis` using `cd`,
then run a text editor called Nano to create a file called `draft.txt`:

~~~ {.bash}
$ cd thesis
$ nano draft.txt
~~~

Let's type in a few lines of text,
then use Control-O to write our data to disk:

![Nano in action](fig/nano-screenshot.png)

Once our file is saved,
we can use Control-X to quit the editor and return to the shell.
(Unix documentation often uses the shorthand `^A` to mean "control-A".)
`nano` doesn't leave any output on the screen after it exits,
but `ls` now shows that we have created a file called `draft.txt`:

~~~ {.bash}
$ ls
~~~
~~~ {.output}
draft.txt
~~~

Let's tidy up by running `rm draft.txt`:

~~~ {.bash}
$ rm draft.txt
~~~

This command removes files ("rm" is short for "remove").
If we run `ls` again,
its output is empty once more,
which tells us that our file is gone:

~~~ {.bash}
$ ls
~~~

Let's re-create that file
and then move up one directory to `/Users/nelle` using `cd ..`:

~~~ {.bash}
$ pwd
~~~
~~~ {.output}
/Users/nelle/thesis
~~~
~~~ {.bash}
$ nano draft.txt
$ ls
~~~
~~~ {.output}
draft.txt
~~~
~~~ {.bash}
$ cd ..
~~~

If we try to remove the entire `thesis` directory using `rm thesis`,
we get an error message:

~~~ {.bash}
$ rm thesis
~~~
~~~ {.error}
rm: cannot remove `thesis': Is a directory
~~~

This happens because `rm` only works on files, not directories.
The right command is `rmdir`,
which is short for "remove directory".
It doesn't work yet either, though,
because the directory we're trying to remove isn't empty:

~~~ {.bash}
$ rmdir thesis
~~~
~~~ {.error}
rmdir: failed to remove `thesis': Directory not empty
~~~

This little safety feature can save you a lot of grief,
particularly if you are a bad typist.
To really get rid of `thesis` we must first delete the file `draft.txt`:

~~~ {.bash}
$ rm thesis/draft.txt
~~~

The directory is now empty, so `rmdir` can delete it:

~~~ {.bash}
$ rmdir thesis
~~~

Let's create that directory and file one more time.
(Note that this time we're running `nano` with the path `thesis/draft.txt`,
rather than going into the `thesis` directory and running `nano` on `draft.txt` there.)

~~~ {.bash}
$ pwd
~~~
~~~ {.output}
/Users/nelle
~~~
~~~ {.bash}
$ mkdir thesis
~~~
~~~ {.bash}
$ nano thesis/draft.txt
$ ls thesis
~~~
~~~ {.output}
draft.txt
~~~

`draft.txt` isn't a particularly informative name,
so let's change the file's name using `mv`,
which is short for "move":

~~~ {.bash}
$ mv thesis/draft.txt thesis/quotes.txt
~~~

The first parameter tells `mv` what we're "moving",
while the second is where it's to go.
In this case,
we're moving `thesis/draft.txt` to `thesis/quotes.txt`,
which has the same effect as renaming the file.
Sure enough,
`ls` shows us that `thesis` now contains one file called `quotes.txt`:

~~~ {.bash}
$ ls thesis
~~~
~~~ {.output}
quotes.txt
~~~

One has to be careful when specifying the target file name, since `mv` will 
silently overwrite any existing file with the same name, which could 
lead to data loss. An additional flag, `mv -i` (or `mv --interactive`),
can be used to make `mv` ask the user for confirmation before overwriting. 

Just for the sake of inconsistency,
`mv` also works on directories --- there is no separate `mvdir` command.

Let's move `quotes.txt` into the current working directory.
We use `mv` once again,
but this time we'll just use the name of a directory as the second parameter
to tell `mv` that we want to keep the filename,
but put the file somewhere new.
(This is why the command is called "move".)
In this case,
the directory name we use is the special directory name `.` that we mentioned earlier.

~~~ {.bash}
$ mv thesis/quotes.txt .
~~~

The effect is to move the file from the directory it was in to the current working directory.
`ls` now shows us that `thesis` is empty:

~~~ {.bash}
$ ls thesis
~~~

Further,
`ls` with a filename or directory name as a parameter only lists that file or directory.
We can use this to see that `quotes.txt` is still in our current directory:

~~~ {.bash}
$ ls quotes.txt
~~~
~~~ {.output}
quotes.txt
~~~

The `cp` command works very much like `mv`,
except it copies a file instead of moving it.
We can check that it did the right thing using `ls`
with two paths as parameters --- like most Unix commands,
`ls` can be given thousands of paths at once:

~~~ {.bash}
$ cp quotes.txt thesis/quotations.txt
$ ls quotes.txt thesis/quotations.txt
~~~
~~~ {.output}
quotes.txt   thesis/quotations.txt
~~~

To prove that we made a copy,
let's delete the `quotes.txt` file in the current directory
and then run that same `ls` again.

~~~ {.bash}
$ rm quotes.txt
$ ls quotes.txt thesis/quotations.txt
~~~
~~~ {.error}
ls: cannot access quotes.txt: No such file or directory
thesis/quotations.txt
~~~
This time it tells us that it can't find `quotes.txt` in the current directory,
but it does find the copy in `thesis` that we didn't delete.
