# Letâ€™s build a real program!  The Chinese Zodiac

## 1. Plan the Program

For us this means understanding the problem and being very clear what the steps are towards creating a solution.  A step is really any part of the program for which we should carry out independent testing to make sure that it works.  This will make the construction of our programs *iterative*.

To understand what it is you are being asked to do download this file from the GitHub repository for this class: **http://bit.ly/1OCXLh9**.  Put it in a directory you are comfortable with and open it in iPython/Jupyter notebooks.  Or you can follow the link and then copy and paste into the notebook.

This file will contain the following instructions as a multi-line comment (note that everything is wrapped inside triple double quotes).

	"""
	While taking a class on the culture of China, you have learned about the Chinese zodiac in which people fall into 1 of 12 categories, depending on the year of their birth. The categories, numbered 0 to 11, correspond to the following animals:

	(0) monkey
	(1) rooster
	(2) dog
	(3) pig
	(4) rat
	(5) ox
	(6) tiger
	(7) rabbit
	(8) dragon
	(9) snake
	(10) horse
	(11) goat

	Those who believe in this zodiac think that the year of a person's birth influences both their personality and fortune in life.

	Your task is to build a program that will ask a user for their birth year and tell them their zodiac sign.  If the user does not enter a number that can be interpreted as a year then an error message must be shown and the user given another chance.  If the user types "quit" then the program halts.

	For extra credit: save each year that is input to a file and print a chart showing how many of each type or animal have been returned.

	To find your zodiac sign, divide the year of your birth by 12. The remainder then determines your sign. For example: The remainder when we divide 1985 by 12, is 5; therefore, a person born in 1985 is an ox according to the Chinese zodiac.
	"""

So, what we need to do now is add comments that will act as placeholders/sign-posts/instructions as we build the program.  So, we add the following to the top of the file:

	#Here we are planning the components of the program.

	#Open the zodiac file

	#Load the file

	#Ask user for input (year)

	#Take year and use as a conditional
	
	#Return horoscope

	#Repeat

	#Below is a description of the task

## 2. Open the File
We need to get a set of zodiac descriptions.  We'll use the file at **http://bit.ly/1KiRoYw** since it is already set up for our purposes.  Collect it however you would like and put it in the same directory as the zodiacTool-0.py file that you are working with.

This is how we'll open the file:

	#Open the zodiac file

	zodiacText = open('zodiacDescriptions.txt')

If we run this though apparently nothing happens.  Here too "silence is golden" and we get what we ask for.  What we want to do is print out the contents of the file.  Opening the file produces a "pointer" that is stored in a variable called "zodiacText".  We can use this pointer and its default return value (lines in the file) to print out the file content.

	#Open the zodiac file

	zodiacText = open('zodiacDescriptions.txt')
	for line in zodiacText:
    	print(line)

Of course, if we open something it is a good idea to explicitly close it and so we do just that at the very end.

	#Repeat

	zodiacText.close()

	#Below is a description of the task

Here we see our first "method".  Methods are functions attached to specific data types that are called with the dot-method format seen here.  Methods are often empty functions, hence the empty parentheses, but this is not necessary.  You can see what methods are available in some interpreters by typing the variable name, adding a period immediately after, and then pressing TAB.

## 3. Load File into a List
We don't actually want to print out the content of the zodiac program for anything other than testing so we'll just comment out the loop and print lines.

	#Open the zodiac file

	zodiacText = open('zodiacDescriptions.txt')
	#for line in zodiacText:
    #	print(line)

Here's how we'll turn the contents of the file into a data type we can use:

	#Load into a list

	zodiacList = []
	for line in zodiacText:
    	zodiacList.append(line)
    
    print(zodiacList)

We first create an empty list and then use a loop to move through the file line by line and add the line to the list.  We do this using the *append* method of lists (note that it is a non-empty function).  Of course we want to check that this has worked by printing the list.

## 4. Ask User for Birth Year and do the math
Users are notoriously problematic to deal with.  Better to create a value to act as a placeholder for the moment and move on.

	#Ask user for input (year)
	birthYear = 1985

With a birth year in hand we can do the math and check the result.  If this works then everything else is just a matter of fancy formatting and error trapping.

	#Take year and use as a conditional (later we'll just access the dictionary directly)

	listLocation = (birthYear - 4) % 12
	print(listLocation)

Why the "-4"?  Our list is out of perfect alignment and fixing the math is easier than fixing the list.  Be careful though, this is not always the case and it can be easy to forget.

We do get the right index value so we can move on.

## 5. Return the Zodiac Character
With the index value in hand we can directly return the character from our list:

	#Return character
	print("You are a ", zodiacList[listIndex])

## 6.  *Really* Ask User for Input
Now that the core mechanics are working we can go back and actually collect input from the user.  This is initially a one line change but in the long run it means we need to do error trapping.

	#Ask user for input (year)
	birthYear = raw_input("What year were you born: ")
	listIndex = (birthYear - 4) % 12
	print listIndex

## 7. Error Trapping
Try putting in anything that isn't a birth year and see what happens: ValueError.  We can catch these with the following set up:

	#Ask user for input (year)
	try:
    	birthYear=int(raw_input('What year were you born: '))
	    listIndex = (birthYear - 4) % 12
    	print listIndex
    
	    #Return character
    	print("You are a ", end="")
	    print(zodiacList[listIndex])
    
	except ValueError:
    	print("You did not enter a number")

## 8. Repeat ==> Functions, loops, and conditionals
We very well may not make it this far.  If that's the case then we'll at least walk through how to read this.

**WARNING** if you have time to do the graphics portion then go to section 9.  If you complete section 8 first then explaining how to add the graphics *after* producing the functions and the repeatability will remove the clarity that doings linearly first provides.

	#Open the zodiac file

	def ZodiacSetup():
    	zodiacText = open('zodiacDescriptions2.txt')
    
    	#Load into a list
	    zodiacList = []
    	for line in zodiacText:
        	zodiacList.append(line)
        
	    zodiacText.close()
    
    	return zodiacList

	def ZodiacFigure():
    	#Ask user for input (year)
	    try:
    	    birthYear=int(raw_input('What year were you born: '))
        	#Take year and use as a conditional
	        listIndex = (birthYear - 4) % 12
    	    print(listIndex)
        
        	#Return character
	        print("You are a ", end="")
    	    print(zodiacList[listIndex])
        
	    except ValueError:
    	    print("You did not enter an integer")
        	birthYear = "Stop"
        
	    return birthYear

	#Repeat
	zodiacList = ZodiacSetup()

	birthYear=0
	while type(birthYear) is int:
    	birthYear = ZodiacFigure()

## 9. Tracking Responses
**NEW.**  This is the first step to producing a simple chart for comparing responses that updates every time a new answer is provided.  The response data is saved and loaded as a hidden file.  As an additional bonus **import** statements are introduced.

Start by adding comments to capture new blocks of code that needed to be added.  These should include:

	# LOAD COUNTS DATA
	# check if the counts of zodiac characters (read-only) file exists
	# if so then initialize a dictionary with its JSON contents and close the file
	# if it doesn't then initialize the dictionary from scratch. No need to specify members.  We'll add them as they come up.

	# UPDATE COUNTS DATA
    # Check if character is in dictionary
    # Add if it isn't
    # Increment if it is
    
    # WRITE COUNTS DATA
    # Open file if it exists or create it 
	# Write Dictionary to JSON
	
Loading the counts data can and should be done first.  When doing this it will be helpful to have a terminal window open so that the hidden file can be revealed with **ls -a** and deleted via **rm** if it gets corrupted.  When complete it should look like:

	import os.path
	import json

	counts = {}
	if os.path.exists('.zodiacCounts.json'):
	    with open('.zodiacCounts.json','r') as infile:
    	    counts = json.load(infile)

Note that *counts* is a dictionary.  JSON makes nice work of these.  Also note the use of the `with` construct which is a safer way of opening files since it automatically closes on exit and (some?) crashes.

The pipeline of reading and writing can't really be checked until both the UPDATE and WRITE portions are done so we might as well do this in order and do WRITE next.  Nothing fancy here, just a test to make sure that a value is in the dictionary before trying to update.

	if zodiacList[listIndex] in counts:
        counts[zodiacList[listIndex]] += 1
    else:
        counts[zodiacList[listIndex]] = 1

Lastly, we need to write to the original file.  We're holding all the necessary content in the counts object so the easiest thing to do is to overwrite the original file.

	with open('.zodiacCounts.json', 'w') as outfile:
    	json.dump(counts, outfile)

## 10. Adding a Bar Plot
The `matplotlib` library makes this easy to do.  Here we throw in the `as` option to show how to rename libraries for terse code.

	# Print the current version of the chart
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    plt.bar(range(len(counts)), counts.values(), align='center')
    plt.xticks(range(len(counts)), list(counts.keys()))

    plt.show()

Note the three stage process here:

1. loading the library
2. setting the criteria for the plot
3. showing the plot

In iPython/Jupyter notebooks the following line should be added to the beginnig of the file to make sure that any charts are printed on the same page as the code that generated them and not opened in their own window.

	%matplotlib inline

## 11. Repeatability part 2
And this is what it should look like all wrapped up and ready to be run again and again.

	#Imports
	import os.path
	import json
	import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
	#special iPython command to stop charts from opening in a new window.
	%matplotlib inline

	# this function loads the descriptions and returns the content
	def loadDesc():
    	#Open the zodiac file
	    zodiacText = open('zodiacDescriptions.txt')

	    #Load into a list
    	zodiacList = []
	    for line in zodiacText:
    	    zodiacList.append(line)

	    #print(zodiacList)

    	zodiacText.close()
    
	    return zodiacList

	# this function loads the counts and returns their values
	def loadCounts():
    	# check if a file with the right name exists
	    # if it does then open the file with the counts of zodiac characters (read-only) and initialize a dictionary with its JSON contents
    	# close the file
	    # if it doesn't then initialize the dictionary from scratch. No need to specify members.  We'll add them as they come up.

    	if os.path.exists('.zodiacCounts.json'):
        	#counts = {}
	        with open('.zodiacCounts.json','r') as infile:
    	        counts = json.load(infile)
	    else:
    	    counts = {}
    
	    print(counts)
    	return counts

	# this function carries out the core work of the program
	def core(birthYear, counts, zodiacList):
    	#Ask user for input (year)
	    try:
    	    birthYear=int(input('What year were you born: '))
        	listIndex = (birthYear - 4) % 12
        	#print(listIndex)

        	#Return character
        	print("You are a ", zodiacList[listIndex])

	        # INCREMENT CHARACTER VALUE IN DICTIONARY
    	    # Check if character is in dictionary
        	# Add if it isn't
	        # Increment if it is
    	    print(zodiacList[listIndex])
        	print(counts)
	        if zodiacList[listIndex] in counts:
    	        counts[zodiacList[listIndex]] += 1
        	else:
            	counts[zodiacList[listIndex]] = 1

	        # Print the current version of the chart
    	    plt.bar(range(len(counts)), counts.values(), align='center')
        	plt.xticks(range(len(counts)), list(counts.keys()))

	        plt.show()
        
    	    return (birthYear, counts)

	    except ValueError:
    	    print("You did not enter a number")
        
        return ("fail", counts)

	#Repeat
	zodiacList = loadDesc()
	counts = loadCounts()

	birthYear = 0

	print(counts)
	while type(birthYear) is int:
    	birthYear, counts = core(birthYear, counts, zodiacList) 

	# Open file if it exists or create it 
	# Write Dictionary to JSON
	# print(counts)
	with open('.zodiacCounts.json', 'w') as outfile:
	    json.dump(counts, outfile)
