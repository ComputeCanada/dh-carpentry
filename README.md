Digital Humanities Content for Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry courses

This repository holds content taken from Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry and modified into courses specifically targeted at the Digital Humanities community.

Look in the *_______Resources* folders for current development materials.  The *OriginalSCMaterial* folder currently holds just raw pulls from the standard Software Carpentry lessons and have yet to see modification. A future step is to merge these two resources once the outlines in the ______Resources folders are complete.

The core document in each of the *_______Resources* folders is a walkthrough file.  This is available in both markdown (the original) and PDF (for display).
